Here at EarthPorn, we like to recognize our top contributors. Some of you may know that 25 submissions is a bit of a milestone here. After 25 submissions, you're eligible to receive a special globe icon next to your username, as a small token of appreciation from the moderation staff. I say eligible because, we have no way of knowing when you submit your 25th submission, you have to tell us!

What you probably don't know is that our top submitters (anyone with an icon) can gain access to our private discussion subreddit (it's sort of like a r/metaearthporn, except that isn't the name). Here we test out new features, have internal moderator discussions (that you can be a part of), and basically shoot the shit.

Why am I telling you this, you may ask? Honestly, it's because I'm tired of searching individual usernames to check and see if they have submitted 25 posts yet, and I would like to be able to add new users to the subreddit to promote discussion (you will be added as an approved submitter after you earn your icon).

So, have you submitted 25 posts already? [Tell us!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23EarthPorn)

What's that, you only have 20, or 15, or 10? [Start submitting!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/submit)

I hope to see you all there soon! Well, some of you. ;)",hpr57,0,0,0,"['neutral', 'surprise']","['neutral', 'disgust']",-1.0,0.0
